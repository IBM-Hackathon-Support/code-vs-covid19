To get an idea of how a solutions need to be designed to run on cloud have a look to [IBM Cloud Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures). There you'll find templates for working cloud solutions.

You may use [diagrams.net](https://www.draw.io/?splash=0&libs=ibm) (former draw.io) to sketch your ideas. It provides a library with IBM Cloud symbols and icons.
