Create a free IBM Cloud Account to get access to runtimes and IBM Watson services:

* Follow [https://ibm.biz/cloud-vs-virus](https://ibm.biz/cloud-vs-virus) to create an account.
* Ask us in our channel [#support-ibm](https://versusvirus.slack.com/archives/C011BGASFPG) to get a unique voucher code

When you received a code from us, go to the IBM Cloud Dashboard:

* Goto `Manage > Account > Account Settings`
* Click `Apply Code`
* Enter the voucher code and click `Apply`
* Optional: Enter your credit card data. Your account will get a $200 credit aftewards.

Without credit card data you can use all services labeled with `lite` for free. With credit card data you can also use all services labeled with `free`, and of course all other services at low cost. The voucher code gives you additional runtime resources for free.

Please tag your project with `ibm-cloud` on [DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-cloud) to allow us to find you and give you pro-active support.
